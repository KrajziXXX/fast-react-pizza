# 🍕 Fast React Pizza Co. — React Application with Redux Toolkit (part of the course)

Fast React Pizza Co. is a frontend application built with React and Redux Toolkit. The project was developed as part of a React course and serves as a portfolio piece focused on strengthening practical skills in global state management and working with external APIs. The application emphasizes clean Redux architecture, slice-based state logic, and a modern, responsive user interface built with TailwindCSS.

## 🦄 Features

Key features of **Fast React Pizza Co.**:

- **Global State Management with Redux Toolkit**
  Application state is managed using Redux Toolkit, providing a predictable and scalable state architecture.

- **Slice-Based Architecture**
  State logic is divided into slices, improving code organization and maintainability.

- **Reusable and Dynamic Components**
  The UI is built using modular, reusable React components.

- **External API Integration**
  Data is fetched from a provided external API, including proper handling of asynchronous state.

- **Responsive UI with TailwindCSS**
  TailwindCSS is used to build a clean, responsive interface with a modern layout.

## 🎯 Application Flow

The application follows Redux’s unidirectional data flow:

1. **Actions are dispatched** from React components
   
2. **Reducers update the state** based on dispatched actions

3. **Updated state is propagated** to subscribed components
