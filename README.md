# 🍕 Fast React Pizza Co. (part of the course)

A project built with React, Redux, and TailwindCSS to practice state management, modular architecture, and modern UI design. This project was created as part of a course to enhance my React and Redux and TaliwindCSS skills and is also part of my personal portfolio. The application focuses on both logic and UI.

## 🦄 Features

Here’s what you can do with **Fast React Pizza Co**:

- **State Management with Redux**  
  The application demonstrates how to manage global state using Redux and `@reduxjs/toolkit`.

- **Slice-Based Logic**  
  State is divided into slices for better modularity and scalability.

- **Dynamic UI Components**  
  The app includes reusable and dynamic components for better maintainability.

- **API Integration**  
  The app fetches data from external APIs to provide real-time updates.

- **Modern UI with TailwindCSS**  
  TailwindCSS is used to create a responsive and visually appealing design.

## 🎯 Application Flow

The application is based on Redux's unidirectional data flow:

1. **Dispatch Actions**  
   Components dispatch actions to trigger state changes.

2. **Reducers Update State**  
   Reducers handle actions and update the state accordingly.

3. **State Propagation**  
   The updated state is propagated to all subscribed components.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Working on this project helped me better understand how to structure and manage state in a React-Redux application.

- **Redux Toolkit**  
  I learned how to use `createSlice`, `configureStore`, and other utilities provided by Redux Toolkit to simplify Redux development.

- **Slice-Based State Management**  
  Dividing state into slices made the application more modular and easier to maintain.

- **TailwindCSS**  
  I gained experience designing modern and responsive UIs using TailwindCSS.

- Enhancing the UI with animations and advanced styling
- Implementing unit and integration tests
- PayCart
